Fixes since 1.0.2:

1. Added support for StAX parser input and StAX writer output.
2. Added method to get and set a user context object to both marshalling and
unmarshalling contexts. This user context object can be anything the user wants
to have available for use with their own extension code. (JIBX-96)
3. Added <binding add-constructors="true"> option to generate no-argument
constructors where needed.

Fixes since 1.1 beta2

1. Fixed a bug in the new add-constructors option which resulted in multiple
copies of the no-argument constructor when the same class was used more than
once in the binding.
2. Fixed a problem with array collections used as only child of <mapping>.
3. Corrected the build version reported by the binding compiler.

Changes since 1.1 beta3

1. Added flexible attribute to structure group (requires ordered="false", all
child components must define element names).
2. Changed mapping type-name and map-as to be namespace-qualified names.
3. Changed format label and value format attributes to be namespace-qualified
names (and changed the names for build-in formats!).
4. Added nillable attribute to object group and value element, supporting the
xsi:nil attribute at runtime (requires element name, not allowed on abstract
mapping)
5. Added create-type attribute to object group.
6. Added direct support for Java 5 enumerations.
7. Fixed problem in using a binding file with no mapping elements, only
includes.
8. Provided J2ME compatibility, with new "j2me" build target to build J2ME
version of the distribution jars.
9. Added support for test-method/get-method/set-method with context as a
parameter.
10. Added support for required elements in ordered="false" groups, along with
checks for repeated elements, defined allow-repeats attribute in structure group
to disable checking.
11. Fixed several problems with multi-dimensional array collections.
12. More checking during binding validation.

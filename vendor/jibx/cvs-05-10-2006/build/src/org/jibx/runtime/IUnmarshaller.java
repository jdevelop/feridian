 * Unmarshaller interface definition. This interface must be implemented
 * by the handler for unmarshalling an object.
 *
 * Instances of classes implementing this interface must be serially
 * reusable, meaning they can store state information while in the process
 * of unmarshalling an object but must reset all state when called to
 * unmarshal another object after the first one is done (even if the first
 * object throws an exception during unmarshalling).
 *
 * The JiBX framework will only create one instance of an unmarshaller class
 * for each mapped class using that unmarshaller. Generally the unmarshaller
 * instance will not be called recursively, but this may happen in cases where
 * the binding definition includes recursive mappings and the unmarshaller
 * uses other unmarshallers (as opposed to handling all children directly).

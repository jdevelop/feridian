<body>
JiBX data binding framework runtime implementation package. These classes are
designed for use in generated code by the binding generator portion of the framework.
They are not generally intended for direct use by end users, and are subject
to more change than the published external APIs.<p>

The only circumstance in which an end user of the framework should need to work
with these classes is when writing a marshaller or unmarshaller for a class.
These replace generated code for the classes involved, and hence allow full
control over the operation of the framework.

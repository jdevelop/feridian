Fixes since 1.0.1:

1. Added "synthetic" flag for classes, fields, and methods added by JiBX to fix
problems in using JiBX with the Agitator testing tool.
2. Corrected an IllegalStateException case during binding validation when a
referenced class was not found in the classpath.
3. Added validation check for name attribute used with reference to either a
non-abstract mapping or an abstract mapping with extensions. (document this).
4. Added validation check for compatible type on structure element with no
property (which uses the same object as the container, but perhaps with a
downcast type).
5. Added warning for non-extension mapping when some sibling classes have
mappings extending the mapping for a parent class.

Fixes since 1.0:

1. Fixed the org.jibx.runtime.Utility class usage of a JDK 1.4 method to restore
compatibility with JDK 1.3.
2. Updated binding.xsd and binding.dtd in docs directory.

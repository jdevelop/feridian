      <h3><a name="intro">Areas for extension</a></h3>

<p>Current plans for JiBX 1.X call for extensions to some of the input and
output options in a 1.1 release, including StAX parser support, but no major new
features. JiBX 1.1 is also planned to integrate stable versions of the <a
href="xsd2jibx/index.html">Xsd2Jibx</a> and <a href="./jibxtools/index.html">Generator
Tools</a> subprojects into the JiBX distribution.</p>

<p>JiBX 2.0 is just getting started, and the work there requires in-depth knowledge of
the code. Even so, there are several areas where interested developers can make
important contributions to the JiBX project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring the Eclipse plugin (currently dropped from distribution, because
there's no one to maintain it) up to date with current versions of Eclipse and
JiBX, then extend it to work with the JiBX binding definition model.
This would allow problem indications for binding definition files, as well as
incremental build support.</li>
<li>Clean up the Ant task code. This currently uses some deprecated Ant
methods, and doesn't support all the options you'd expect in terms of
structuring the file sets.</li>
<li>Build a GUI Wizard front-end for the binding generator. The binding
generator is undergoing some major enhancements in preparation for the 1.1
release, including the addition of an XML configuration file for control
information (replacing the lengthly list of command line parameters now in use).
A Wizard could initialize settings from an existing configuration file, then
save the file and pass it to the actual binding generator code when the user is
done making their choices.</li>
<li>Provide an adapter for JiBX to be used with Spring (or other favorite IoC
framework).</li>
<li>Set up JUnit tests that complement or replace many of the blackbox test
cases in the <i>/build/test</i> tree of the distribution, using the bind-on-load
approach so class file don't need to be modified on the disk. Testing error
conditions in bindings would be especially useful, since the current tests are
all designed to compile and execute correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, another interesting project will
be integrating <a href="http://www.xbis.org">XML Binary Infoset</a>
representation (XBIS) support into JiBX for extremely fast document transfer.
One preliminary step in this direction is extending XBIS with an <a
href="http://www.xmlpull.org">XMLPull</a> encoder and decoder, so that's another
related project that someone could take on.</p>

<p>If you're interested in working in any of these areas (or have your own ideas
for extending JiBX) check first on the <i>jibx-dev</i> email list to see if
anyone else is already working in the same area.</p>

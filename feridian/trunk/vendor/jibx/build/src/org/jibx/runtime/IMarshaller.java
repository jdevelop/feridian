 * reusable, meaning they can store state information while in the process
 * of marshalling an object but must reset all state when called to
 * marshal another object after the first one is done (even if the first
 * object throws an exception during marshalling).
 *
 * The JiBX framework will only create one instance of a marshaller class
 * for each mapped class using that marshaller. Generally the marshaller
 * instance will not be called recursively, but this may happen in cases where
 * the binding definition includes recursive mappings and the marshaller
 * uses other marshallers (as opposed to handling all children directly).
